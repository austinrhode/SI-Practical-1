"""
Write a program that prompts the user to enter three things,
the number of sides a shape has,
the length of those sides,
and the number of shapes that they want to draw.

Once you have this information, your program should draw regular polygons
with the number of sides indicated with the correct length.
After drawing each polygon, it will rotate and draw the next, such that all
the polygons drawn are in a circle (aka they an equal number of degrees apart out of 360 degrees in a circle)

After drawing each shape, you program should switch pen colors
cycling between three colors of your choice.
So the first shape could be blue, then the second red, then the third green, then the fourth blue, and so on.

Your program also need to keep track of the total permiter of all shapes drawn
and print that out at the end.

You program should also use TDD. I can't make you do this, but they will on the real exam.
